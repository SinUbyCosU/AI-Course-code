# 1. Search

Figuring out what move to make. Finding a solution to a problem, like a navigator app that finds the best route from your origin to the destination, or like playing a game and figuring out the next move.

## 1.1 Agents
An entity that perceives its environment and acts upon that environment. In a navigator app, for example, the agent would be a representation of a car that needs to decide on which actions to take to arrive at the destination.
Agents are that Plans

## 1.2 State Spaces and Search Problems
- **1.2.1 State Space Size**
- 
  **State**: A configuration of an agent in its environment.
  
     - **Initial State:** The state from which the search algorithm starts. In a navigator app, that would be the current location.

## 1.4 Informed Search
Search strategy that uses the knowledge specific to the problem to find the better solution.
